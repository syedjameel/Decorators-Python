## Assignment-1
Decorators in Action :)
Software Design with Python


## Description:
This Assignment consists of 4 tasks. Each task is written in a separate module i.e. task1.py, task2.py ... task4.py.
And this tasks are run by a single driver code main.py


## How to run:
1. clone this branch
2. go to ~/src folder
3. In terminal run $ python3 main.py


## Testing:
In the main.py file you can see the decorator_1, decorator_2, decorator_3, decorator_4, decorator_4_function.
These are the decorators you can add one by one on a funtion of your choice to test it. You can just uncomment
whichever decorator you may like on any function.

Also you may test the error handling for the decorators_4 and decorator_4_function.
The decorator_4 is using the class and the decorator_4_function is based on function but the final output will be same.



Finally, Open for improvements ;)
